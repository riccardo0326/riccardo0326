## 🚀 About Me

Computer Science student at Università di Ferrara, currently in the thrilling phase of my academic journey where I have *big dreams* and *small GitHub contributions*!

I'm passionate about building cool stuff, capturing the world through lenses (both literal and digital), and occasionally getting lost in the mountains. Think of me as someone who codes with my left brain and creates with my right brain (they're in constant conflict 😄).

## 📊 GitHub Stats (The Honest Edition)

I'm working on making this section less embarrassing, one commit at a time. Currently in *preparation mode*, but soon you'll see my repositories flourish with projects that'll make you say "oh, that's actually pretty cool!"

## 🎓 The Goal

Finish my CS degree while building a portfolio that doesn't look like it was made by someone who only knows `console.log("hello")`. So far, so good! 🚀
